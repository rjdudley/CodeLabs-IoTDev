# Build 2016 IoT Code Labs #

## Module 1

This is an introduction to Windows 10 IoT Core on the Raspberry Pi 3.

[Module 1 - Windows 10 IoT Core](Module1-IntroWindows10IoTCore/)

## Module 2 and Module 3

These two labs introduce Microsoft Azure IoT features, including IoT Hub. Module 2 does not require any device. Module 3 uses a Raspberry Pi 3 and a GHI FEZ HAT. Other than client hardware, the two labs cover the same material.

[Module 2 - Azure IoT - No Device](Module2-IntroAzureIoT-NoDevice/)

[Module 3 - Azure IoT - Windows 10 IoT Core with Raspberry Pi 3](Module3-IntroAzureIoT-WindowsIoTCore/)

## Module 4

This is an open hack which runs concurrently with other labs. We have a ton of devices in the room, as well as reference material for most of them.
